# Reeda Meadows (1955-2025)

Reeda Meadows (Williams), a devoted mother, died peacefully on May 27, 2025
at the Durham Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Durham, NC at the age of 70, after a long battle with dementia.

Born in Greenville, SC to James and Vaneda Williams, she was raised “all over the place”
due to her father’s career in the United States Air Force.
Her favorite of all the places she lived was the few years she spent as a young child in Bermuda,
which she talked about frequently to her children.

She earned a Bachelor of Business Administration from Southwest Texas State University
and began working as an auditor for the IRS, where she met her former husband, Karl.
The two married in Houston, TX, and welcomed their two children there, Jeffrey and Karleen.

The family made a big move to Pittsburgh, PA in 1993,
with both her and Karl transferring internally within the IRS.
They started attending Berkeley Hills Lutheran Church,
where they both became very involved volunteering teaching Sunday School and leading youth programs.
Soon, Reeda changed careers, becoming the Director of Christian Education at BHLC,
where she grew the youth ministries and Vacation Bible School enrollment significantly.

At home, Reeda cherished spending time with her children,
especially reading to them when they were young.
She also relished any chance to play a game.
She enjoyed all kinds: card games, board games, yard games, but most of all: Pictionary.
Her children and their friends will always remember how much she loved to play and
the entertainment her drawings supplied: something she loved to laugh with everyone at the table about.

In retirement, she moved to North Carolina to live near her daughter, Karleen.
Even in the midst of battling dementia, she was absolutely delighted to meet the oldest two of her four grandchildren,
exhibiting how deep-seated her mothering nature truly was.

Reeda was preceded in death by both of her parents,
and is survived by her son, Jeffrey (Kelly); daughter, Karleen (Joshua Beaver);
her 4 grandchildren; and her brother, James Williams Jr. (Michelle).

A Celebration of Life will be held at 3 PM on Saturday, July 12, 2025 at Chatham Community Church
([1685 Andrews Store Road, Pittsboro, NC 27312](https://maps.app.goo.gl/b1hhNpw4y3QrbpMo9){:target="_blank"}).
Please RSVP to [rsvp@reedameadows.com](mailto:rsvp@reedameadows.com).

In lieu of flowers, the family asks that you make online gifts in memory of Reeda to the Dementia Society of America
